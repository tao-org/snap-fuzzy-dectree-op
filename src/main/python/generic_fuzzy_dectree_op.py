# This operator class implementation serves as a template for writing SNAP operators in Python.
# It is shown how thw source products and it's data is accessed, how the values
# of the parameters, specified in the accompanying generic_fuzzy_dectree_op-info.xml file, are retrieved and
# validated. Also how the resulting target product can be defined along with flags, masks, etc. is
# shown in this example. A guide about the development of a python operator can be found at
# http://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SNAP/How+to+write+a+processor+in+Python
# For further questions please consult the forum at http://forum.step.esa.int
